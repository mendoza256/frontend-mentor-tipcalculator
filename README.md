## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on the sizes given by the challange
- See hover states change for some interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- actually forgot mobile-first workflow, but re-did it later
- Javascript (mostly looked at tutorials here and there and adapted the code to fit my project)

### What I learned

The most frustrating things I had to overcome were: The struggle with CSS margins and paddings not adjusting how I thought they would. Either because I forgot about the concept of collapsing margins, or I had declared a padding/margin somewhere else on the element and forgot. From now on I'll try to use "margin-bottom" only and "box-sizing: border-box", wherever it makes sense.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I wanna tidy up all the code. I feel like especially the CSS code is lacking cleanliness.
There's also still some hiccups in the javascript calculation.

### Useful resources

There's a youtube tutorial doing this challenge, I looked at it for the most parts of the JS code, as I never did JS on a website before. It felt a bit like cheating, but I still learned a lot on how to apply JS to web pages.
